// Homework 12
// Team Gas Optimisation Game
// Follow the README instructions for the gas optimisation team game in the repo https://extropyio-soliditybootc-4kqp2fbby1g.ws-us74.gitpod.io/
// These are in the Exercises\Gas directory
// Your team should try to reduce the amount of gas used to deploy the contract, and when
// running transactions.
// You can change the code as much as you like, but you must not change the tests, and
// your contract must pass all tests.
