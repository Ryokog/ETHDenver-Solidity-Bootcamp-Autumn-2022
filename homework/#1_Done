What are the essential pieces of functionality ?
How would people cheat ?
How could you prevent them from cheating ?

Answer 1
Monopoly itself would not hold.
Just as nodes are spreaded across entities in Web3, players of monopoly will also need to be wide-spread across various stakeholders.
There is no cheating in the sense that everything is open and public.
The way to prevent them from front-run others, we may need to set a time lock on certain things.
In other words, limit what can be changed in a given time period.
