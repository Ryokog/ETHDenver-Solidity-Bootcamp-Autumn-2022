// Homework 7
// We made a payment mapping, but we havenʼt added all the functionality for it yet.
// Write a function to view the payment records, specifying the user as an input.
// What is the difference between doing this and making the mapping public ?
//. For the payments record mapping, create a function called recordPayment that
// takes
// . the senderʼs address,
// . the receiverʼs address and
// . the amount
// as an input, then creates a new payment record and adds the new record to the
// userʼs payment record.
// . Each time we make a transfer of tokens, we should call the this recordPayment
// function to record the transfer.
