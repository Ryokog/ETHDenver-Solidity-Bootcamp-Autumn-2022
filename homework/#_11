// Homework 11
// Continue developing your Volcano NFT project
// 1. Add a function that allows a user to mint an NFT if they pay 0.01 ETH, or an amount of
// Volcano coin (decide on a price yourself).
// . Make sure that when a token is minted we can specify a token URI - a location where
// we can store metadata / images for the NFT.
// . What would be the problem with providing a function to allow us to change the token
// URI ?
// . Review the notes about the EVM in Lesson 5 in preparation for tomorrow's lesson
// about gas optimisation.
